        <h2>To make these air fryer chicken legs—crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside—all you need is 5 ingredients and an air fryer. These chicken drumsticks are quick, easy, and seasoned just right.</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skin-on chicken drumsticks</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Combine garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Place drumsticks on a clean work surface. Sprinkle spice mix evenly over all sides of the drumsticks.</li>
            <li>Place drumsticks in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken over and cook for 10 minutes more. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
